2. workers threads
    - The worker_threads module enables the use of threads that execute JavaScript in parallel
    - Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations
    - They will not help much with I/O-intensive work. Node.js’s built-in asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than Workers can be.
    - Unlike child_process or cluster, worker_threads can share memory

3. How do worker threads work? (https://blog.insiderattack.net/deep-dive-into-worker-threads-in-node-js-e75e10546b11)
    - JavaScript language does not have multi-threading features
    - Therefore, Node.js Worker Threads behave in a different way than traditional multi-threading
    - In Node.js, a worker’s responsibility is to execute a piece of code (worker script) provided by the parent worker
    - The worker script will then run in isolation from other workers, with the ability to pass messages between it and the parent worker
    - In Node.js, each worker will have its own instance of V8 and Event Loop
   
4. Advanatages of workers over child process
    - Thread workers are more lightweight and share the same process ID as their parent threads
    - They can also share memory with their parent threads

5. Websocket
    - WebSocket protocol opens a much faster and more efficient line of communication between client and server 
    - It provides by-directional communication using tcp connection
    - Establishes a persistent connection between client and server
    - low latency communication and imporves the perfomance
    

6. Socket.io
    - Socket.IO is a library which enables real-time and full duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers
    - It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface
    - It works on all platform, server or device ensuring the equality, reliability, and speed.


7. Unit testing
    - UNIT TESTING is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested
    - The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed
    - A unit is the smallest testable part of any software
    - In procedural programming, a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure, etc
    - In object-oriented programming, the smallest unit is a method, which may belong to a base/ super class, abstract class or derived/ child class. 

8. Mocha
    - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework runs on Node.js and in the browser
    - Its widely used with Node.js
    - It provides functionality for testing both synchronous and asynchronous code with a very simple and similar interface.
    - Mocha provides a variety of interfaces for defining test suites and individual tests

9. Chai
    - Chai is a assertion library for node and the browser 
    - Can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework
    - Can use chai to write tests like English sentences
